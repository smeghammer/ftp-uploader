# FTP Uploader

A simple python3 application for uploading a file to an FTP server. Specifically triggered by [this Doomworld post](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/118982-uploading-to-idgames-a-difficult-and-discouraging-experience/).

The main requirement was for a Drag and Drop interface. I decided that buggering about with tkinter was a rabbit hole I didn't want to disappear down, so I decided to write a CLI application and interfcae with it via desktop shortcuts and batch/shell files.
